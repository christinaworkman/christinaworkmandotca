# Description
This plug-in allows you to use TypedJS in your WordPress installation. TypedJS is a typewriter style animation to engage your users and catch their attention. The text will be typed out. Just put your content between the `[typedjs][/typedjs]` tags. Use the + sign to use the backspace feature.
The additional parameters map up to TypedJS so `typespeed` parameter is in milliseconds and `loop` can only be `true` or `false`. It will add a typing effect.Added parameter for the cursor styles just use standard CSS as shown in the installation instructions. I'd recommend using !important if it doesn't work the first time.
